## [2.2.2] - 20-01-2021

## [2.2.0] - 10-01-2021

### Changes

**ModFile.getDependencies** and **ModFile.getDependenciesFiles** now contain another parameter called `categories` which defaults to an array of `[3]`. This parameter can be used to specify which type of dependencies to get.

### Added

**CurseForgeAPI.DEPENDENCY_TYPE** is an enum containing a list of categories to use for getting dependencies.

## [2.1.1] - 27-12-2020

### Fixes

**ModFile.getDependenciesFiles** now returns an empty array if no dependencies exist instead of running forever.

## [2.1.0] - 28-04-2020

### Changes

**ModFile.download** now takes a new argument called `simulate` with which you can just try to download a file without creating a new file. If you're not using callbacks everything should work just fine. There's also `url` now which should always refer to `this.download_url` and `tries`. Tries is used to avoid redirects loop and cancels a download if more than 10 redirects are send.
